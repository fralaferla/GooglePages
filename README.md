### Just some basic workout with HTML and CSS
There is a JS file but it's just for a dropup menu. Plus, I know in the two .css files there's redundancy that could be solved, maybe putting more ids on elements, maybe through SASS and inheritance but hey, felt too lazy to create a .scss,
remember all its syntax, open the prompt and compile it so here you go, you have two .css files with some redundant lines.
